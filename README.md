# Amazon-Sales-Dashboard
This repository contains a comprehensive project that combines Python for data analysis and Power BI for data visualization, focusing on Amazon sales data. The project demonstrates how to extract insights from raw sales data and transform it into interactive, visually appealing dashboards.

# Tool used: Python and Power BI

# Data Analysis with Python:
Cleaned and preprocessed Amazon sales data using Pandas.
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.


# Data Visualization with Power BI:
Created dynamic dashboards that provide an interactive user experience.
Visualized key metrics.
Integrated slicers and filters for deeper data exploration.

# Files Included:
dataset for data cleaning and analysis on Python.
Power BI file (.pbix) containing the final dashboard.
Documentation on how to reproduce the analysis and set up the Power BI dashboard.

# How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the Python scripts to preprocess and analyze the data.
Open the Power BI file to explore the interactive dashboard.

# Requirements:
Python 3.x
Power BI Desktop
Required Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
This project is a great resource for anyone looking to learn how to combine Python and Power BI for data-driven decision-making. Explore the repository and see how you can apply these techniques to your own datasets!
